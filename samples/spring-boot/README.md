This is in progress. Presently it is the vanilla Gradle and Maven builds from
[Spring Initilizr](https://start.spring.io/) with these settings:

- Project: "Gradle - Groovy" or "Maven"
- Language: Java
- Dependencies: Spring Boot DevTools, Lombok, Spring Configuration Processor,
  Spring Web, Spring Boot Actuator, Spring REST Docs

There are minor tweaks such as updating package/project name and build script
versions.
